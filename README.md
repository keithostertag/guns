Guns from the Estate of Vaughn P

This site was created for a friend who needed to advertise guns for sale from her late husbands estate.

For security reasons, all contact info was purposely held back- she will provide the url to selected prospective buyers and other interested 
people for a period of several months.

This site uses flexbox and jquery, and may not work with older browsers. Mobile users will get rescaled photos for performance and limited 
presentation (using media queries).

All photographs by Keith Ostertag.
